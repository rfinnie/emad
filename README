In June of 2003, a worm transmitted through weak software via IRC
started spamming us all with dire warnings of Miss Cleo's
injustice against someone named Ethom.  The story went that she
had put him in a Mindjail, and some messages wailed like banshees
imploring us to get poor Ethom out.  Here are a few samples from
my logs:

01:46 <akcrpxwzn> Miss Cleo has put a curse on Ethom, now Ethom
	is trapped in mindjail, help him out...
	http://66.222.28.114:3030/
06:25 <bczexzzfs> E-thom is trapped in mindjail, mindjail is a
	trap for your brain, see if you can get him out!
	http://211.186.45.24:3030/mindjailworm: (child) [69]
	dccspam irc.slashnet.org
09:10 <gpqfxvvcf> Ever heard of a thing called mindjail? Check
	it: http://61.101.91.237:3030/
09:01 <pcokrfepi> EEEEEEETHHHOOOM! MINDJAIL!! HE IS TRAPPED!! GET
	HIM OUT! http://24.167.37.66:3030/

Of course, the local prankster and all around goofball on our
local hangout is one Emaddin El-Haraty.  It didn't take long
before the topic of the channel read "EEEEEEEMAAAD! MINDJAIL!!!
HE IS TRAPPED!! GET HIM OUT!"

Thus the comment "based on a true story".  Atob wrote the
original emad in python, and released it via the local user list
for zork.net.  It was quickly mutated and contributed to, and cvs
on zork was soon provided.  Needing a good set of example code
for an autoconf tutorial I was giving, I rewrote it in C with the
ncurses panels library.

No, of course you can't quit.  What kind of mindjail would THAT
be?
